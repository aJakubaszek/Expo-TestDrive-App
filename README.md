Car Showcase Expo is an interactive mobile app that allows users to explore a car from every angle and gain an in-depth look at its interior. Users can customize their car by selecting different packages, colors, and features to create their ideal configuration.

The app also offers the option to sign up for a test drive (TestDrive API not included in the project) and experience the car in person. Additionally, users can browse through a gallery of car images (freshly loaded from company website on each startup, with correct masks depending on image orientation), to get a closer look at various models and features.
